# Overview
This project utilizes the "Ultimate UFC Dataset" available on Kaggle, which contains comprehensive information about all UFC fights from mid-2010 to mid-2021. 
The analysis focused on extracting relevant information about the events and the fighters.

I'm a big martial arts fan and this was my debut project intended to enhance my portfolio.
